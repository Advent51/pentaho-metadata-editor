applicable version of this License or the recipients
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You

        <p>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.
        <p>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
the license contains terms which differ from this License.

<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF

INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.</a>

<li> U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</li>
<p>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.
    </p>
<li> MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
    <p>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    </p>
<li> RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</li>
    <p>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.

<dl>
<dd>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br><br>

<dd>b) its license agreement:<br><br>

<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</a> <br><br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b> <br><br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.</a> The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. <br><br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. <br><br>
5. <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense2">NO WARRANTY<br><br>
</b>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. </a><br><br>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense2">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY <br><br>
</b>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense2">NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </a>
</a><br><br>
7. GENERAL<br><br>
</b>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. <br><br>
<a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</a><br><br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. <br><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. <br><br>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br>

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
</p><p>
<a name="returnAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a)</a> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, <a name="feeForSoftwareRestrictionLicense">royalty-free copyright license</a> <a name="copyRestrictionLicense">to reproduce</a>, <a name="modificationRestrictionLicense">prepare derivative works of</a>, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
</p><p>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, <a name="expressPatentLicenseRestrictionLicense">each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</a>
</p><p>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
</p><p>
d) <a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</a>
</p><p>
3. REQUIREMENTS
</p><p>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
</p><p>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
</p><p>
b) its license agreement:
</p><p>
i) <a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</a>
</p><p>
ii) <a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</a>
</p><p>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
</p><p>
<a name="openSourceAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">iv)</a> <a name="openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</a>
</p><p>
When the Program is made available in source code form:
</p><p>
<a name="includeAddedCodeRestrictionLicense">a) it must be made available under this Agreement;</a> and
</p><p>
b) <a name="includeLicenseRestrictionLicense">a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</a>
</p><p>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
</p><p>
<a name="sourceNoticesRestrictionLicense">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</a>
</p><p>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
</p><p>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense">if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.</a> The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
</p><p>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
</p><p>
5. NO WARRANTY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorDisclaimerRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</a>
</p><p>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
</p><p>
<a name="distributorExcludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</a>
</p><p>
7. GENERAL
</p><p>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
</p><p>
<a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</a>
</p><p>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
</p><p>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.

<LI> Restrictions.
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> The copies of Software provided to you under this
Agreement are licensed, not sold, to you by Sun. Sun
reserves all rights not expressly granted. 
<LI> You may
make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise
may not copy, modify, or distribute Software. However
if the Sun documentation accompanying Software lists
specific portions of Software, such as header files,
class libraries, reference source code, and/or
redistributable files, that may be handled
differently, you may do so only as provided in the Sun
documentation. 
<LI> You may not rent, lease, lend or
encumber Software. 
<LI> <a name="reverseEngineerOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense">Unless enforcement is
prohibited by applicable law, you may not decompile,
or reverse engineer Software.</a> 
<LI> The terms and
conditions of this Agreement will apply to any
Software updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion,
that replace and/or supplement the original Software,
unless such update contains a separate license. 
<LI> You may not publish or provide the results of any
benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any
third party without the prior written consent of Sun.
<LI> Software is confidential and copyrighted. 
<LI> Unless otherwise specified, if Software is delivered
with embedded or bundled software that enables
functionality of Software, you may not use such
software on a stand-alone basis or use any portion of
such software to interoperate with any program(s)
other than Software. 
<LI> Software may contain programs
that perform automated collection of system data
and/or automated software updating services. System
data collected through such programs may be used by
Sun, its subcontractors, and its service delivery
partners for the purpose of providing you with remote
system services and/or improving Sun's software and
systems. 
<LI> Software is not designed, licensed or
intended for use in the design, construction,
operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and
Sun and its licensors disclaim any express or implied
warranty of fitness for such uses. 
<LI> No right, title
or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo
or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under
this Agreement.</OL>
<P>
<LI> Term and Termination.
<P>
The license and service term are set forth in your
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
materially breach it or take any action in derogation
of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun
may terminate this Agreement should any Software
become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual
property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use
of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in
writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will
survive termination of the Agreement.
<P>
<LI> Java Compatibility and Open Source.
<P>
Software may contain Java technology. You may not
create additional classes to, or modifications of, the
Java technology, except under compatibility
requirements available under a separate agreement
available at www.java.net.
<P>
Sun supports and benefits from the global community of
open source developers, and thanks the community for
its important contributions and open standards-based
technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
products.
<P>
Please note that portions of Software may be provided
with notices and open source licenses from such
communities and third parties that govern the use of
those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do
not alter any rights and obligations you may have
under such open source licenses, however, the
disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
provisions in this Agreement will apply to all
Software in this distribution.
<P>
<LI> Limited Warranty.
<P>
Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from
the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if
any) will be free of defects in materials and
workmanship under normal use. Except for the
foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your
exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this
limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace
Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
Some states do not allow limitations on certain
implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you.
This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.
You may have others, which vary from state to state.
<P>
<LI> Disclaimer of Warranty.
<P>
UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE
DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.
<P>
<LI> Limitation of Liability.
<P>
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER
CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by
you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated
warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states
do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
consequential damages, so some of the terms above may
not be applicable to you.
<P>
<LI> Export Regulations.
<P>
All Software, documents, technical data, and any other
materials delivered under this Agreement are subject
to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to
export or import regulations in other countries. You
agree to comply strictly with these laws and
regulations and acknowledge that you have the
responsibility to obtain any licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery
to you.
<P>
<LI> U.S. Government Restricted Rights.
<P>
If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the
U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime
contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
Government's rights in Software and accompanying
documentation will be only as set forth in this
Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201
through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for
non-DOD acquisitions).
<P>
<LI> Governing Law.
<P>
Any action related to this Agreement will be governed
by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No
choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.
<P>
<LI> Severability.
<P>
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect
with the provision omitted, unless omission would
frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case
this Agreement will immediately terminate.
<P>
<LI> Integration.
<P>
This Agreement, including any terms contained in your
Entitlement, is the entire agreement between you and
Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and
warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment,
or other communication between the parties relating to
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.
No modification of this Agreement will be binding,
unless in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of each party.</OL>

<br>

</dl><h2>Preamble</h2>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. <br><br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br><br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br><br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br><br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br><br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. <br><br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. <br><br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br><br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. <br><br>
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br><br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. <br><br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br><br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. <br><br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br><br>
<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2><b>0.</b> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>
A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br><br>
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) <br><br>
&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br><br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. <br><br>
<b>1.</b> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br><br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br><br>
<b>2.</b> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br><br>
<dl>
<dd>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br><br>

<dd>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>

<dd>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. <br><br>

<dd>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. <br><br>

<dd>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) <br><br>

<dd>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br><br>

<dd>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. <br><br>

<dd>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br><br>

</dl>3.</b> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. <br><br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br><br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. <br><br>
4.</b> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. <br><br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>
5.</b> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br><br>
However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. <br><br>
When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br><br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br><br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br><br>
6.</b> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br><br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br><br>

<dd>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. <br><br>

<dd>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. <br><br>

<dd>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br><br>

<dd>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>

</dl>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br><br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br><br>
7.</b> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br><br>

<dd>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>

</dl>8.</b> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br><br>
9.</b> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br><br>
10.</b> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br><br>
11.</b> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <br><br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br><br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br><br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br><br>
12.</b> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br><br>
13.</b> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br><br>
14.</b> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br><br>
NO WARRANTY <br><br>
15. </b>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br><br>
16.</b> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br><br>
<h2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h2>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). <br><br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>

<dd>Copyright (C) year name of author <br><br>

<dd>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>

<dd>modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>

<dd>License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>

<dd>version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>

<dd>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>

</dl>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. <br><br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: <br><br>

patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)&nbsp; agree in writing to
pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect

</ul><b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</a><b>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b>
<ul>
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
</ul><b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
<ul>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California
law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
</ul><b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.
</ul><b>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b>
<ul>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.&nbsp;
Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the

in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention 
as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation.

  granted: 1)   for code that You delete from the Original Code;
  2) separate from the   Original Code; or 3) for infringements
  caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
  combination of the Original Code with other software or
  devices.
<P>
2.2. Contributor Grant.
<P>
  Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
  Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-
  exclusive license
<P>
  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
  trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,
  modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
  Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions
  thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
  Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger
  Work; and
<P>
  (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
  selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
  and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
  portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for
  sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications
  made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the
  combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its
  Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
<P>
  (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
  effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use
  of the Covered Code.
<P>
  (d)  notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license
  is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
  the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor
  Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
  modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of
  Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;
  or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
<P>
3. Distribution Obligations.
<P>
3.1. Application of License.
<P>
  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
  are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
  Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
  or a future version of this License released under Section
  6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
  copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
  impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
  restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
  additional document offering the additional rights described
  in Section 3.5.
<P>
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
<P>
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
  must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version
  or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
  to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
  available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
  available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
  initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
  subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
  made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
  ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
  if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
  third party.
<P>
3.3. Description of Modifications.
<P>
  You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
  contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
  or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the
  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<P>
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
<P>
  (a) Third Party Claims.
<P>
  If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
  party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
  2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
  distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the
  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
  will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
  knowledge after the Modification is made available as
  described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
  the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
  thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
  to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
  knowledge has been obtained.
<P>
  (b) Contributor APIs.
<P>
  If Contributor's Modifications include an application
  programming interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of
  patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
  that API, Contributor must also include this information in
  the LEGAL file.
<P>
  (c) Representations.
<P>
  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
  Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
  Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
  Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
  by this License.
<P>
3.5. Required Notices.
<P>
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
  particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
  must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
  directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
  notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
  add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
  Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
  documentation for the Source Code where You describe
  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered
  Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
  or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer.
<P>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
<P>
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
  Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
  this License, including a description of how and where You
  have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
  describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
  may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
  license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
  the Executable version under a different license You must make
  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
  License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
  the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
  such terms You offer.
<P>
3.7. Larger Works.
<P>
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
  case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Code.
<P>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
<P>
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
  this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
  due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
  extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
  they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
  file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
  distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
  able to understand it.
<P>
5. Application of this License.
<P>
  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
  has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered
  Code.
<P>
6. Versions of the License.
<P>
6.1. New Versions.
<P>
  Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
  be given a distinguishing version number.
<P>
6.2. Effect of New Versions.
<P>
  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
  version of the License, You may always continue to use it
  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
  such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
  the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the
  right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
  under this License.
<P>
6.3. Derivative Works.
<P>
  If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
  you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
  already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a)
  rename Your license so that the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public
  License," or "SPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
  appear in your license (except to note that your license
  differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
  that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
  from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
  described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
  modifications of this License.)
<P>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
<P>
  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS''
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
  COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
  THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
  (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
  THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
  THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
<P>
8. TERMINATION.
<P>
  8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
  herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
  aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
  effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
<P>
  8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
  against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is
  referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
<P>
  (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
  granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
  2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days
  after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to
  pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for
  Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
  Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
  respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.
  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
  arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
  parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
  automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
  period specified above.
<P>
  (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
  Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
  Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
  effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
  distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
  Participant.
<P>
  8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
  Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
  Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
  claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
  the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
  reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
  under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
  determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
<P>
  8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
  above,  all end user license agreements (excluding
  distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by
  You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.
<P>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<P>
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR
  OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
  LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
  COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
  BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
  OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
  THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<P>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
<P>
  The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is
  defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
  software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
  12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
  Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
  rights set forth herein.
<P>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.
<P>
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning
  subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
  held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
  only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except
  to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
  entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
  States of America, any litigation relating to this License
  shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of
  the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa
  Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
  the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
  regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
  License.
<P>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
<P>
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party
  is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
  indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
  License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
  basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
  constitute any admission of liability.
<P>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
<P>
  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code
  as ?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the
  Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the
  Covered Code under Your choice of the alternative licenses, if
  any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described
  in Exhibit A.
<P>

newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new 

knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>

<dd>(b) Contributor APIs.<br><br>

<dd>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface 

(&quot;API&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably 

necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 

file.<br><br>

<dd>(c) Representations.<br><br>

<dd><a name="IPWarrantRestrictionLicense">Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, 

Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) 

and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License</a><br>

<dd>.<br><br>

</dl>3.5. Required Notices.<br><br>
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not 

possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You 

must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be 

likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add 

your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate 

this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights 

or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense1">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee 

for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of 

Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 

Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such 

warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby 

agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 

the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 

liability terms You offer.</a><br><br>
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br><br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 

3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 

Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 

including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. 

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related 

documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered 

Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a 

license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that 

You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable 

version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version 

from the rights set forth in this License. <a name="indemnificationRestrictionLicense2">If You distribute the Executable version under a 

different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 

License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You 

hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 

incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 

offer.</a><br><br>
3.7. Larger Works.<br><br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the 

terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, 

You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered 

Code.<br><br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to 

some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 

(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe 

the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL 

file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source 

Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 

sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>
5. Application of this License.<br><br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 

Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>

<dl>
<dd>6.1. New Versions. <br><br>

<dd>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (&quot;Sun&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the 

License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 

<br><br>

<dd>6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br><br>

<dd>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may 

always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 

Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No 

one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 

under this License.<br><br>

<dd>6.3. Derivative Works.<br><br>

<dd>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order 

to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: 

(a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Sun Public License,&quot; 

or &quot;SPL&quot;../ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license 

(except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear 

that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Sun Public License. 

(Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice 

described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 

License.)<br><br>

</dl><a name="disclaimerRestrictionLicense">7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br><br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;../AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE 

COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 

NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS 

WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 

DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 

CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO 

USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</a><br><br>
8. TERMINATION.<br><br>

<dl>
<dd>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 

fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 

aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall 

survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in 

effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br><br>

<dd>8.2. <a name="patentRetaliationRestrictionLicense">If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 

declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 

Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 

&quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:<br><br>

<dd>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, 

then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 

this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if 

within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a 

mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by 

such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor 

Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and 

payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation 

claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 

2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified 

above.<br><br>

<dd>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor 

Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 

Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first 

made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br><br>

</dl>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 

Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 

claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 

infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 

Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount 

or value of any payment or license.</a><br><br>
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license 

agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or 

any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>
<a name="excludeDamagesRestrictionLicense">9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br><br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 

CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 

DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON 

FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, 

WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 

MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 

HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL 

NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE 

TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 

EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 

LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU</a>.<br><br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br>
The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 

2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and 

&quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot;../ as such terms are used in 48 

C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 

through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only 

those rights set forth herein. <br><br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br><br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any 

provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 

to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California 

law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding 

its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a 

citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of 

America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the 

Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara 

County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without 

limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the 

United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 

excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 

construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br><br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and 

damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License 

and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 

responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to 

constitute any admission of liability. <br><br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 

?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial Developer permits you to 

utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, 

specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>
Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.<br>
